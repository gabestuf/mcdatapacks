# XP = Worldborder datapack

gabestuf's version of this datapack.

### Start

/trigger xpborder:start to start
/trigger xpborder:reset to reset

### Description

Border grows 1 block each direction for each level. Borders shrink upon losing levels. Meant for multiplayer, might be too hard/slow in single player. Works well enough...

### 'Features' to consider that I may possibly fix though probably not

- If players leave, the border will shrink.
- Border always spawns around 0 0 coordinates.
- XP Level/border size only shrinks when player respawns (not on death). This allows you to kill another player and take the xp, gaining another level and increasing the border. Of course, the border will shrink when the player clicks respawn, but it may be useful if you really need materials one block away.

### Version: 1.20.0 - 1.20.4
